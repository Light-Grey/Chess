# Chess
A little game of chess I decided to make in Python. Been enjoying the game lately!

Current Functionality:
  - Move pieces by giving start and end squares
  - Will only allow moves to be played on the correct players turn (White includes the capital pieces)
  - Informs player of invalid moves
#IN PROGRESS#
